\title{Create a Multiframe Object}
\usage{
multiframe(x, y, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The multivariate data (a matrix, list, or other data container)}

\item{y}{A design matrix or data frame with same number of rows/elements as x}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods}
}
\value{
A multiframe object containing:
  \item{design}{A tibble with design variables and observation functions}
}
\description{
Constructs a new multivariate design object linking vector-valued observations with
arbitrary design variables. A multiframe combines experimental design metadata with 
lazy-evaluated observations, providing a flexible interface for data manipulation.
}
\details{
A multiframe object is similar to a multidesign but with enhanced support for data frame 
operations. Key features include:
* Lazy evaluation of observations (only loaded when needed)
* Integration with tidyverse functions for data manipulation
* Support for various data sources (matrices, lists, vectors)
* Methods for splitting, summarizing, and transforming data
}
\examples{
# Create sample data
X <- matrix(rnorm(20*100), 20, 100)
Y <- tibble(condition = rep(letters[1:5], 4))

# Create multiframe object
mf <- multiframe(X, Y)

# Access first observation
obs1 <- mf$design$.obs[[1]]()

# Split by condition
split_by_cond <- split(mf, condition)

# Summarize by condition
means_by_cond <- summarize_by(mf, condition)
