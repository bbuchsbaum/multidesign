\title{Create Cross-Validation Folds from a Hyperdesign Object}
\usage{
\method{fold_over}{hyperdesign}(x, ..., inclusion_condition = list(), exclusion_condition = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A hyperdesign object}

\item{...}{Unquoted names of variables to split on (e.g., condition, subject, run)}

\item{inclusion_condition}{Optional list specifying values to include in assessment sets}

\item{exclusion_condition}{Optional list specifying values to exclude from assessment sets}
}
\value{
A foldlist object containing the cross-validation folds
}
\description{
Creates cross-validation folds by splitting the data based on specified design variables.
Each fold consists of a training set (analysis) and a test set (assessment).
}
\details{
The function creates folds by splitting the data based on unique combinations of the specified
variables. For each fold, one combination is held out as the assessment set, while the rest
form the analysis set.

Important considerations:
* If a splitting variable is confounded with blocks (e.g., each subject is in a separate block),
  the function will fail as there would be no training data available for that block.
* Numeric variables (like run numbers) are handled by converting them to factors for splitting.
* The function preserves the design structure within each fold.
