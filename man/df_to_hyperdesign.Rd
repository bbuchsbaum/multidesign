\title{Convert a Data Frame to a Hyperdesign Object}
\usage{
df_to_hyperdesign(data, design_vars, x_vars, split_var)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or tibble containing both design variables and response variables}

\item{design_vars}{Character vector specifying the names of design variables (e.g., conditions, factors)}

\item{x_vars}{Character vector specifying the names of response variables to extract}

\item{split_var}{Character string naming the variable to split the data on (e.g., "subject" or "session")}
}
\value{
A hyperdesign object containing multiple multidesign objects, one for each unique value in split_var
}
\description{
This function creates a hyperdesign object from a data frame by splitting it according to a specified variable.
It's particularly useful when you have a wide-format data frame that needs to be converted into multiple
related multidesign objects, such as when dealing with multiple subjects or sessions in an experiment.
}
\examples{
# Create a sample tibble with multiple subjects
sample_tibble <- tibble(
  felab = rep(1:2, each = 3),
  attention = rep(c("DA", "FA"), times = 3),
  basis = rep(c("basis01", "basis02", "basis03"), times = 2),
  subject = rep(1001:1002, each = 3),
  `1` = rnorm(6),  # response variable 1
  `2` = rnorm(6),  # response variable 2
  `3` = rnorm(6)   # response variable 3
)

# Convert to hyperdesign, splitting by subject
hd <- df_to_hyperdesign(
  data = sample_tibble,
  design_vars = c("felab", "attention", "basis"),
  x_vars = as.character(1:3),
  split_var = "subject"
)
}
