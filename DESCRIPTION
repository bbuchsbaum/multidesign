Description: Manage and analyze complex experimental designs with multiple data blocks 
    and nested structures. Implements methods for design matrix manipulation, 
    cross-validation, and data splitting with support for lazy evaluation and 
    memory-efficient processing. The package integrates with the 'tidyverse' ecosystem 
    and extends functionality of 'tibble' and 'dplyr' for experimental design workflows.
